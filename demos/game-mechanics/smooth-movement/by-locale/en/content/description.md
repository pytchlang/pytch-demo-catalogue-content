# Version 1

Keep the speed in a variable.  Even though we don't change the value,
giving it a name makes the code easier to read and easier to change.

Continuously check for movement keys being pressed, and adjust our X
or Y coordinate if needed.  This simple version does not check for
where the player is on the screen, so you can move the ship right
outside the screen.


# Version 2

## `x_limit`, `y_limit`

Likewise, keep the X and Y coordinate limits (the furthest we want the
player to be able to go left and right, and up and down) in variables.


# Version 3

## `x_velocity`, `y_velocity`

These variables DO change as the player plays the game.  They track
the current speed of the player in each dimension.

## `accel`

This variable doesn't change value, but (as above) it's useful to
give it a name.  This is the acceleration, which says how quickly
the player's speed changes.

### Drift

Continuously check for movement keys being pressed, and adjust our X
or Y velocity if needed, up to the "speed" limit.  <mark>If neither
left/right key is pressed, drift the horizontal velocity (x_velocity)
towards zero.  And if neither up/down key is pressed, drift the
vertical velocity (y_velocity) towards zero.  Then update the position
according to the velocity, making sure we don't go outside the screen
limits.</mark>

It might also be nice to eventually have a pytch filetype if the
project structure become more complex and we ever ended up needing
different filetypes for different purposes (like maybe for raspberry
pi projects or )
